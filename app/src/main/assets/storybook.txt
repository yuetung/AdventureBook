It's dark here. Wonder what happened.
Flickering light shines through the window.
You can't see where the exit is.
Looks like there's a cupboard near it.
# Look through the window # 1 # none

@ 1 none
As you walk towards the window, the flickering light is gone.
You can hear some murmuring outside.
The window is locked, strangely.
The cupboard disappears into the darkness.
# Unlock the window # 5 # windowKey # 1

You opened and searched the cupboard.
Felt something inside, it's warm and, probably alive.
It's not making any noises.
Oh, is that some stones?

You felt something solid inside the cupboard, probably a key for the window.
How convenient.
# Walk towards the window # 1 # none

@ 4 none
You screamed for help. You hear someone's footsteps.
It's getting louder.
Oh, the cupboard appears again.
But it does looks a bit different from before.

"Clank!"
The window makes a huge noise as it opens.
It might had alerted someone.
# Go outside # 8 # none

@ 6 none
You can see the door now.
Light shines onto you as the person walks towards you.
You should have known better.
Screaming is a bad idea.
Looks like he's holding a knife.

You run towards the cupboard and attempted to squeeze yourself into it.
You felt something warm beside you.
Out of a sudden, that thing moves.
# Run out of the cupboard # 6 # none
# Stay inside # 12 # none
~
@ 8 none
You run out from the window.
But there is nothing outside. A giant void.
Looks like someone has to add some more stories here.
You might want to reset.

@ 9 none
The person blocks your way.
Of course, life is never so easy.
# Charges at him # 10 # none
# Attack him with your knife # 11 # knife # 1 # chance # 0.3 # 19

@ 10 none
"Hey! Chill there! if we wanted your life, we would have done that long time ago!"
Says the person as he grabbed your arm.
"Now would you just calm down and have a little chat with me?"
# Listen to what he says # 13 # none
# Attack him with your knife # 11 # knife # 1 # chance # 0.3 # 19
~
@ 11 none
You charges at him with your knife.
You stabbed his chest with all your might.
You watch as he slowly bleeds to death.
Well, guess the only monster left in this room is you.
# Walk out from the door # 8 # none
~
@ 12 knife 1
You feel something sharp piercing your leg as it starts to bleed.
You grabbed the knife and fought back.
Huh? The warm thing is now gone.
# Get out from the cupboard # 6 # none
~
@ 13 none
"Well, we just need a little something here.
As you might have seen, the world outside this room now is nothing but a giant void.
We need you to come out with more stories and make sure this world is filled up with horrifying things. You agree?"
# Agree # 14 # none
# Disagree # 15 # none

@ 14 none
"Thank you! guess we'll let you live for a while longer.
If you wish, you could change the story through the storybook.txt file inside the assets folder.
Read the first 2 lines and make sure you understand the syntax fully.
To add an item, modify the resources.txt file.
That's all for now, I guess."
You might want to reset.

@ 15 none
"Well, I'm just going remove that option.
Let me ask you again, would you help with the story?"
# Agree # 14 # none

@ 16 none
"Hey! Stop that!"
The person screams as he appears to retreat a little.
# Keep Throwing stones at him # 17 # stone # 1
# Run towards the door # 20 # none # chance # 0.7 # 9
# Charges at him # 10 # none

"I'm warning you! Stop that!"
The person screams as he appears to retreat a little further.
# Keep Throwing stones at him # 18 # stone # 1
# Run towards the door # 20 # none # chance # 0.6 # 9

He dodges your attack.
Seems like he's waiting for you to run out of stones.
# Keep Throwing stones at him # 18 # stone # 1
# Run towards the door # 20 # none # chance # 0.5 # 9

"Hey! Chill there! if we wanted your life, we would have done that long time ago!"
Says the person as he skillfully grabbed your arm and disarmed you.
You're totally defenseless now.
"Now would you just calm down and have a little chat with me?"
# Listen to what he says # 13 # none
~
@ 20 none
You ran towards the door as fast as you could, dodging him.
He attempted to chase after you.
But as you reached the door, he just stopped moving, as if he's remembering something.
"Why not you open the door and see for yourself?" He said.
# Open the door # 21 # none
~
@ 21 none
You opened the door.
But there is nothing outside. A giant void.
He started giggling.
"Why not we have a deal?" He says.
# Listen to what he says # 13 # none
# Jump into the void # 22 # none
~
@ 22 none
Seriously?
Is that the best option you can come out with?
You fall into the void as you contemplate your mistake.
Looks like you have to reset.

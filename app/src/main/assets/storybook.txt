It's dark here. Wonder what happened.
Flickering light shines through the window.
You can't see where the exit is.
Looks like there's a cupboard near it.

As you walk towards the window, the flickering light is gone.
You can hear some murmuring outside.
The window is locked, strangely.
The cupboard disappears into the darkness.

You opened and searched the cupboard.
Felt something inside, it's warm and, probably alive.
It's not making any noises.
Oh, is that some stones?
# Keep searching # 3 # none

@ 3 windowKey 1
You felt something solid inside the cupboard, probably a key for the window.
How convenient.
# Walk towards the window # 1 # none

@ 4 none
You screamed for help. You hear someone's footsteps.
It's getting louder.
Oh, the cupboard appears again.
But it does looks a bit different from before.

"Clank!"
The window makes a huge noise as it opens.
It might had alerted someone.
# Go outside # 8 # none
# Scream for help # 4 # none

@ 6 none
You can see the door now.
Light shines onto you as the person walks towards you.
You should have known better.
Screaming is a bad idea.
Looks like he's holding a knife.
# Run towards the door # 9 # none
# Charges at him # 10 # none
# Throw stones at him # 16 # stone # 1
# Attack him with your knife # 11 # knife # 1

@ 7 none
You run towards the cupboard and attempted to squeeze yourself into it.
You felt something warm beside you.
Out of a sudden, that thing moves.
# Run out of the cupboard # 6 # none
# Stay inside # 12 # none

@ 8 none
There is nothing outside. A giant void.
Looks like someone has to add some more stories here.
You might want to restart.

@ 9 none
The person blocks your way.
Of course, life is never so easy.
# Charges at him # 10 # none
# Attack him with your knife # 11 # knife # 1

@ 10 none
"Hey! Chill there! if we wanted your life, we would have done that long time ago!"
Says the person as he grabbed your arm.
"Now would you just calm down and have a little chat with me?"
# Listen to what he says # 13 # none
# Attack him with your knife # 11 # knife # 1
~
@ 11 none
You charges at him with your knife.
You watch as he slowly bleeds to death.
Well, guess the only monster left in this room is you.
# Walk out from the door # 8 # none
~
@ 12 knife 1
You feel something sharp piercing your leg as it starts to bleed.
You grabbed the knife and fought back.
Huh? The warm thing is now gone.
# Get out from the cupboard # 6 # none
~
@ 13 none
"Well, we just need a little something here.
As you might have seen, the world outside this room now is nothing but a giant void.
We need you to come out with more stories and make sure this world is filled up with horrifying things. You agree?"
# Agree # 14 # none
# Disagree # 15 # none
# Attack him with your knife # 11 # knife # 1

"Thank you! guess we'll let you live for a while longer.
If you wish, you could change the story and my dialogue through the storybook.txt file inside the assets folder.
Be careful of the syntax though.
To add an item, modify the resources.txt file. That's all for now, I guess."

Let me ask you again, would you help with the story?"

"Hey! Stop that!"
The person screams as he appears to retreat a little.

"I'm warning you! Stop that!"
The person screams as he appears to retreat a little further.

He dodges your attack.
Seems like he's waiting for you to run out of stones.
